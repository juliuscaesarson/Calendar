Creative Portion:

Users can share an event with another user (5 points)

Used a dropdown menu when selecting which user to share the event to (2 point)

Used a hidden form that opens when the share or edit icon is selected (3 points)

Implemented a vertical scrolling function if there are too many events in one day (1 point)

Implemented a horizontal scrolling function if title exceeds width of column (Max number of characters for title in MySQL database is 40 characters anyway) (1 point)

Used date selector and time scroller for easier selection of date and time and also for sanitized inputs (1 point)

Used Font Awesome icons for share, edit, and delete buttons for aesthetics (1 point)

Events have one of 3 tags (work, personal, and school) which are color coded and can be toggled in calendar view (5 points)

Used Bootstrap buttons for toggling event tags where you can click another button to switch event tags or click on the same button to disable (1 point)

Calendar can also be used in mobile view (tested on iPhone) but not the most aesthetic appearance (1 point)

Note: date and time input types work in Chrome but not Safari
