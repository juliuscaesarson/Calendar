Simple Calendar with vanilla JS, HTML/CSS, and a MySQL database on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) server

Features:
Users can share an event with another user 

Implemented a vertical scrolling function if there are too many events in one day

Users can use a date selector and time scroller for easier selection of date and time and also for sanitized inputs (only works in Chrome)

Events have one of 3 tags (work, personal, and school) which are color coded and can be toggled in calendar view
